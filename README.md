A Blackjack simulator to simulate the effects of card-counting, if it actually works and the measures casinos might want to take to reduce it's effectiveness.

The rules the simulator plays by can be found here https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/b/Blackjack.htm

Currently I've managed to code the simulator to simulate games of Blackjack between two robots, with each party "hitting" while their hand is worth less than 17 cards, and in this simulation, the house has an edge of 4.5%. The aim of this project is to see if there is a system that reduces this edge and tips it in the favour of the gambler.
